  <h3>CtCI 2.1</h3>
  <p>We at ECONOMIX.IO get it.  We know you're tired of duplicate numbers.  Tired of reading 3 and 4 and 7 over and over and over again.  If you had told me 10 years ago that I would be the one to put an end to all that, I'd have called you crazy!  But here we are, 10 years later, and I am proud to announce that we have, with hard work and determination, done just that! Duplicate number... BE GONE!</p>
